# Main Repository for Agile Project

## GUI prototype
Currently, the GUI has 9 button on the top and bottom to represents the 9 circles for the player and the AI. It also has an incomplete menu with some basic options. The Text Area in the center represents the main play area and if you click on a button, it will append text to the Text Area in a new line.

## TODO:
- Change shape of the buttons
- Complete the menu
- Add a second Text Area to the center
