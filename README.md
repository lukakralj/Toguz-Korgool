# Main Repository for Agile Project

## GUI prototype
Currently, the GUI has 9 oval shaped button on the top and bottom to represents the 9 circles for the player and the AI. It also has an nearly complete menu with some basic options. The Text Area in the center represents the main play area and if you click on a button, it will append text to the Text Area in a new line. The front and back end have recently been merged and some basic integration tests have been implemented. The GameWindow class is also responsible for saving/loading the game.

### TODO:
- Complete the menu
- Complete Custom Input Window
- (other items listed in TODO comments)
